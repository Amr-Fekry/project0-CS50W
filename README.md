# Project0 - CS50W
This project is my first submission to [CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/course/) course

### Project idea
I saw [this infographic](http://carlcheo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/which-programming-language-should-i-learn-first-infographic.png) that recommends the programming language that a beginner should learn first depending on his purpose and interest. I liked the idea and decided to transform it into a [web interface quiz](https://amr-fekry.github.io/project0-CS50W/).

### Repository Contents
The [github page](https://amr-fekry.github.io/project0-CS50W/) of the repo takes you to _index.html_ which is the homepage of the quiz. When you start the quiz you will have to answer one or more questions that exist in _questions_ folder. Depending on your answers, the recommeded language card from _result_ folder will be displayed. Finally, you have the choice to go to _table.html_ that compares all languages or restart the quiz and try a different path.

### Technologies used
HTML, CSS, SASS, BOOTSTRAP

### For CS50W staff
Hello there, if you are manually checking the project requirements, you will find:
* Bootstrap requirements in any card inside _result_ folder
* CSS & SASS requirements in _styles.scss_
* HTML requirements in _table.html_
